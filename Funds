Investment Funds
- Use algorithms to constantly screen securities and monitor the market for best opportunities
- Access to all mkt data, screen investments based on certain rules E.g. financial ratios
- Publicly traded funds hv more liquidity than private funds (E.g. hedge funds, PE funds)

Advantage of investing in funds
- Help investors 1/ save time from screening investments 2/ pick the right investment 3/ at the right time
- Diversitication (ideally -ve correlation) can be achieved by small amt of money
    - achieved by: 1/ Asset Class 2/ Geography 3/ Sector (stock) 4/ Type of Asset (E.g. Growth stock - perform well in strong economy vs Div stock - good in depressed economy) 
- Lower T-costs than buying stocks individually (funds have lower cost as they are institutions)

Investment Company Act of 1940 (ICA) requirements
- Securities must be held by custodians, not by the fund
- >= 90% of fund's taxable income must be distributed to investors
- Cannot buy on margine nor short-sell
- Cannot hold > 10% of a firm's assets
- Register and report to SEC
- Capital structure restrictions: The fund cannot issue bonds or preferred stocks, and they can only borrow from banks

Disadvantages
- Fees might be high, especially hedge funds
    - Note that for investors to profit: return from funds should be > (market lv + fees)
- Inability to customize and tailor portfolio
    - Maybe good for inexperienced investors

Types of Funds
- Mutual Funds
    - Investors are shareholders (It is a ltd firm)
    - Benefit: can also sell or redeem at NAV
    - Can be MMF, Eqt funds, FI funds, or hybrid

- Closed-End funds (CEF)
    - Constant no. of shares, traded publicly
    - no new shares can be created, nor redeemed

- Unit Investment Trusts (UIT)
    - CEF with predefined periods of investments (hv an expiration date on what investments are held in the portfolio: redeem any PnL on that date)
    - It is a "Trust"

- Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF)
    - use arbitrage to ensure its value = NAV

- Hedge Funds
    - not subject to ICA <- can use riskier investment strategies E.g. Short-sell, derivatives
    - Required minimum net worth

- Private Equity Funds
    - PE firms are the fund managers that invest in ventures and PEs
    - Highly illiquid, long investment time horizon

- Master Limited Partnerships (MLP)
- Managed futures
- Annuities



Mutual Fund Company
- A company that receive money from investors and invest
- Under ICA

Mutual Fund
- The portfolio of investments
- Less risky but also less profitable than a single underlying such as stocks
Traits
- Can only execute orders at the end of day. Price/share = NAV
- No bid/ask spreads
- No options
- May have min. investment requirement
- Allows automatic order using money from saving accounts (Automatically reinvest income received)
- Allows fractional shares

ETF: traded just like a stock
- Allows different types of orders E.g. limit/ stop/ short-sell
- Options
- Buy on margin
- Prices may differ sig. from NAV
- Have bid/ask spreads
- ...
No min. deposit requirement
Cannot be bought automatically using money from saving accounts
Low fees charged cuz components X change too often
Tax advantages
No fractional shares

Open-End Mutual funds
- offers shares continuously and may redeem the shares (If investors want out)
- To prepare for the redeem by investors, they must keep a lot of cash or sell securities to get cash < may reduce return for other investors < Cost more fees
- Purchased at NAV from fund at end of day
- NAV = (Total Assets - Total Liabilities)/ No of Outstanding Shares = Value of Fund/ No of Outstanding Shares

Close-End (Mutual) funds
- Only do a IPO and no more share issuance < Money got will be used to invest
- Investors can only trade in secondary market (stock exchange) like stocks (CEF will not redeem)
- Have NAV but not too meaningful cuz cannot use arbitrage to equalize the price (Main difference with ETFs)
- often trade at discount in secondary mkt

ETF vs CEF
- ETFs can arbitrage, as theres a mechanism that allows ETF issuers (Autorizd Participants) to exchange ETF with component stocks
- Price and NAV will be approx. equal but not exactly because of "frictions" in the market
- E.g. If price > NAV, APs buy component stocks from mkt -> Exchange to ETF shares -> sell ETF shares on mkt

First ETF: SPY (SPDR/ Spider) that tracks SPX

2019 onwards, Fund Managers can convert mutual fund to ETFs
Fractional shares of former mutual funds will be redeemed as ETF X hv fractional shares
Advantages:
- For investors: Lower fees as ETFs X need to pay redemptions and hv lower tax
- For fund managers: investors stays during conversion, hence no need to market new ETF

Maybe the only disadvantages of ETFs are 1/ hv spreads 2/ price may not be exactly the same as NAV 3/ maybe illiquid (while for mutual funds investors can exit at anytime)

Expense Ratio = Total Operating Expenses/ Avg NAV
All others being equal, the lower the better


Measuring Mutual fund performance
1/ NAV

2/ Yield = Income Distribution per Share/ Price per share
Income Distribution per Share = Dividend or interests earned

3/ Total Return
Total Pnl = Current share value + Income distributions (cash received) - Initial investment(+fees)
          = Capital + Income distributions

Income distributions = profits from div and interests
Capital distributions = Current price - initial investment

Mutual Fund Price = NAV per share/ (100% - Sales Charge %)

For investors,
Ask price (when they buy) = NAV + any fees
Bid price (when they redeem) = NAV only
